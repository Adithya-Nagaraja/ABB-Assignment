# Azure Cost Optimization Recommendations

## Scenario
A company has the following Azure resources:  
- 10 Virtual Machines (VMs) for development and production  
- 5 SQL Databases  
- Multiple Storage Accounts (hot, cool, and archive)  
- App Services and networking components  

**Goal:** Reduce monthly Azure costs without impacting performance.

## Step 1: Assess Current Resource Usage

1. Log in to the **Azure Portal**  
2. Open **Azure Advisor** → select **Cost** recommendations.  
3. Review recommendations for:  
   - Idle or underutilized resources  
   - Opportunities for resizing or tier changes  
   - Potential shutdown or deletion  

**Example:**  
- VM `dev-vm-01` has 10% CPU utilization → candidate for downsizing.  
- Storage account `logs-storage` contains old logs → move to cool/archive tier.


## Step 2: Right-Size Compute Resources

1. Check performance metrics for VMs and App Services (CPU, memory, disk I/O).  
2. Resize over-provisioned resources:  
      Example: `Standard_D4s_v3` → `Standard_D2s_v3`.  
3. Consider **Reserved Instances (RI)** or **Savings Plans** for predictable workloads.  

**Example:**  
- 3 production VMs run 24/7 → buy 1-year RI for ~40% savings.  
- Development VMs used only 9–5 → schedule auto-shutdown.
  

## Step 3: Optimize Storage Costs

1. Identify cold or rarely accessed data.  
2. Move hot-tier blobs to **Cool** or **Archive** tiers.  
3. Implement **lifecycle management policies** to auto-transition or delete old data.  

**Example:**  
- Logs older than 90 days → Archive tier (~80% cheaper).  
- Delete unused snapshots to save storage costs.


## Step 4: Database Cost Optimization

1. Review SQL Database utilization metrics (DTUs or vCores).  
2. Right-size databases or adjust pricing tiers:  
    Example: `Standard S3` → `Standard S2`.  
3. Enable auto-pause for development/test databases.  
4. Review backup retention policies to avoid excess storage.  

**Example:**  
- Dev SQL database runs only 8 hours/day → auto-pause saves ~60% monthly cost.


## Step 5: Network & Resource Cleanup

1. Identify unused networking resources:  
   - Public IPs, load balancers, VPN/ExpressRoute connections  
2. Delete or downscale idle resources.  
3. Review network egress patterns for optimization.

**Example:**  
- Old VPN gateway `vpn-gateway-01` not used → remove to save ~$100/month.


## Step 6: Implement Monitoring & Alerts

1. Enable **Azure Cost Management + Billing**.  
2. Set budgets and alerts for overspending.  
3. Tag all resources by **environment, project, and department**.  
4. Schedule monthly review of Azure Advisor recommendations.

**Example:**  
- Tag `dev`, `prod`, `test` to identify cost patterns.  
- Monthly reports highlight idle resources and cost spikes.


## Step 7: Continuous Optimization

- Repeat Steps 1–6 monthly.  
- Adjust Reserved Instances or Savings Plans annually based on usage trends.  
- Evaluate new Azure services that could replace high-cost resources.


**Outcome:**  
Implementing these steps can help reduce Azure costs by **20–50%** depending on current resource usage and optimization strategies.
